# google-before-asking
Here is why you should google things before asking to chat groups

All starts when i was in a server and someone, asked for something about a configuration. That's normal, then peson B responses with a screenshot of the wiki, but the user still not undesrtanding what to do. After that, another person C, sended a screenshot of the screenshot where a part of text says what he needs to do. Then he asked for wiki, and then i started creating this resource. 

Searching in goole is something you must know to do, and you must do first of all things, then, you will have enough information to ask in text servers or channels. 

The people doesn't have a lot of free time dedicated to solving your questions, and the goal of this project is to provide users the knowledge why they can't go to ask all questions without searching first.
