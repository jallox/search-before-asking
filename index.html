        <h1>Search Before Asking Online</h1>
        
        <p>
            Nowadays, there are many online chat groups aimed at helping beginners in programming understand concepts or solve problems. However, many users ask trivial questions that could easily be answered with a quick Google search. Hereâ€™s an example:
            <div class="chat">
                <div class="username">User1 <span class="date">4 minutes ago</span></div>
                <p class="content">Hi, does anyone know a way to print "Hello world" in Python?</p>
                <div class="username">User2 <span class="date">just now</span></div>
                <p class="content">Hi, you could use the print("Hello world") method.</p>
            </div>
            Here we can see how User1 asked a question in an online chat, and User2 took the time to read and respond. All this could have been avoided if User1 had searched:
            <div class="search">Print text in Python</div>
        </p>
    
        <h2>Why search before asking?</h2>
        <p>
            When someone asks:
            <div class="chat">
                <div class="username">User1 <span class="date">4 minutes ago</span></div>
                <p class="content">Hi, can anyone help me? When deleting a file in Python, I get an error...</p>
            </div>
            it might give the impression that they're looking for someone to solve the problem without trying to resolve it first. In reality, what the user might mean is something like:
            <div class="chat">
                <div class="username">User1 <span class="date">4 minutes ago</span></div>
                <p class="content">
                    Hi, I want someone to give me the solution. I'm having an issue with Python when trying to delete a file, and I get an error (...). <strong>Can anyone help me fix this?</strong> Thanks in advance.
                </p>
            </div>
            Another example is when someone asks for help with something that could be resolved by checking the tool or library's documentation:
            <div class="chat">
                <div class="username">User1 <span class="date">4 minutes ago</span></div>
                <p class="content">Hi, does anyone know how to create a starter project in <span class="italics">React</span> using <span class="italics">NPX</span>?</p>
                <div class="username">User2 <span class="date">3 minutes ago</span></div>
                <p class="content">The command for creating an empty project is in the <span class="italics">React</span> documentation.</p>
                <div class="username">User1 <span class="date">2 minutes ago</span></div>
                <p class="content">Oh, thanks. Could you send me the wiki link?</p>
                <div class="username">User2 <span class="date">1 minute ago</span></div>
                <p class="content">ðŸ¤¬</p>
            </div>
            This type of situation is more common than it seems and takes up other users' time, which can cause delays or distractions.
        </p>
    
        <h2>What to do first</h2>
        <p>
            First, try searching on Google. For example, in the case of <span class="italics">creating an empty React project</span>, instead of going to a chat and asking, try searching on Google:
            <div class="search">How to start an empty project using React and NPX</div>
            If you don't find the desired result, try adjusting the keywords:
            <div class="search">How to create a React project with NPX</div>
            Changing the words can help you find more relevant results.
        </p>
    
        <h2>When to ask</h2>
        <p>
            Chat groups exist to solve doubts, and asking questions isnâ€™t wrong. However, itâ€™s important to know when to ask. If youâ€™ve already searched on Google and checked at least 2-3 different sources without finding a solution, then itâ€™s appropriate to ask in the chat:
            <div class="chat">
                <div class="username">User1 <span class="date">4 minutes ago</span></div>
                <p class="content">
                    Hi, Iâ€™m trying to create a project in React. <strong>Iâ€™ve searched on several sites</strong> and none have solved my problem. When I run the command, I get an error (...). Could anyone help? Thanks.
                </p>
            </div>
            It's also valid to ask if you have a specific and detailed question that Google is unlikely to answer, for example:
            <div class="chat">
                <div class="username">User1 <span class="date">4 minutes ago</span></div>
                <p class="content">
                    Hi, Iâ€™m trying to create a Python application that, when running the <code>sudoku</code> command, generates 200 sudoku grids. Does anyone know how to generate 200 grids without affecting performance? Thanks.
                </p>
            </div>
            Here, the question <span class="italics">Does anyone know how to generate 200 grids without affecting performance?</span> is specific and relevant to the application in question.
        </p>
